        <h3>Do air freshener molecules float around or do they just drop?</h3>
        <p>??????????????????????????</p>
        <h3>Does my cat go down the road to have sexy time with another local cat? </h3>
        <p>Probably, he's such a sly dog</p>
        <h3>Why do the two brains inside me fight? One always wins and it's a sin</h3>
        <p>No I am not psychotic, I just think that all people have two seperate brains, and one is stronger than the other when it comes to certain things.</p>
        <h3>Why did I make this page in the first place? I don't like blogs at all</h3>
        <p>Maybe I'm telling myself it's a blog, but its really not</p>
